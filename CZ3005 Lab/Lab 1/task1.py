#Task 1: You will need to solve a relaxed version of the NYC instance where we do not have the energy 
#constraint. You can use any algorithm we discussed in the lectures. Note that this is equivalent to 
#solving the shortest path problem. The solution quality of your algorithm will affect the grade.
